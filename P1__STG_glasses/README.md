# STG glasses
In this project we produce a Smart Tour Guide (STG) to design and develop a technological solution that enhances the experience of tourists visiting ancient Egyptian sites by providing them with accurate information, effective communication. The Smart Tour Guide will be designed in the form of glasses, which will allow tourists to use it easily at any time and will be equipped with advanced hardware and software technologies to achieve its features.

STG provides the usual uses  like kings' face recognition then providing information about them, translate ancient Egyptian language (hieroglyphics ), capturing photos, playing music,  searching about information, QR-code scanning and showing time. You can get all services easily using voice commands, which make it a easy-to-use product suitable with current evolution.
